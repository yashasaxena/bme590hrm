Running the Code:
---
Pull from ClassComposition branch.
Set up Conda environment (bme590hrm).

To run our program: In your Python script, import ECG_Patient as ecp_p (or however you wish to define it).

Instantiate an object of the Patient class.

For example:

    import ECG_Patient as ecg_p

    John_Smith = ecg_p.Patient(5/60, 'test_data5.csv', tachy_limit=110, brachy_limit=75, return_file='John_Smith.txt')

    John_Smith.create_patient_file()

This will create a file named John_Smith.txt in your current directory with the results of our HR monitor.
